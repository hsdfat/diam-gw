Protocol Specification and Implementation

7.1

Introduction

7.1.1

Use of Diameter base protocol

The Diameter base protocol as specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61] shall apply except as modified by the defined support
of the methods and the defined support of the commands and AVPs, result and error codes as specified in this
specification. Unless otherwise specified, the procedures (including error handling and unrecognised information
handling) shall be used unmodified.

7.1.2

Securing Diameter Messages

For secure transport of Diameter messages, see 3GPP TS 33.210 [16].
If there are no intermediate Diameter Agent networks located between the visited PLMN and the home PLMN, the HSS
or the first Diameter Agent located in the home PLMN which has direct connection with the serving network is required
to check that the realm contained in the Origin-Realm AVP in the request from the serving network corresponds to the
right serving network.
If there are intermediate Diameter Agent networks located between the visited PLMN and home PLMN, the first
Diameter Agent which has direct connection with the serving network is required to check that the realm contained in
the Origin-Realm AVP in the request from the serving network corresponds to the right serving network.
NOTE 1: How to do the above check is implementation specific, e.g. it may be done by checking if the IP addresses
of the serving network nodes match with the realm received in the Origin-Realm AVP in the request.
NOTE 2: Network configurations where a (potential) visited PLMN acts as intermediate Diameter Agent network
are not allowed.
NOTE 3: In the case there are intermediate Diameter Agent networks, the home network has to trust these
intermediate Diameter agent networks to do the check and other hop by hop security check. This trust is
usually substantiated by contracts since there are no remote technical means to verify if the checks were
actually performed.

7.1.3

Accounting functionality

Accounting functionality (Accounting Session State Machine, related command codes and AVPs) shall not be used on
the S6a, S6d, S13 and S13' interfaces.

7.1.4

Use of sessions

Between the MME and the HSS and between the SGSN and the HSS and between the MME and the EIR, Diameter
sessions shall be implicitly terminated. An implicitly terminated session is one for which the server does not maintain
state information. The client shall not send any re-authorization or session termination requests to the server.
The Diameter base protocol specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61] includes the Auth-Session-State AVP as the mechanism
for the implementation of implicitly terminated sessions.
The client (server) shall include in its requests (responses) the Auth-Session-State AVP set to the value
NO_STATE_MAINTAINED (1), as described in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. As a consequence, the server shall not maintain
any state information about this session and the client shall not send any session termination request. Neither the
Authorization-Lifetime AVP nor the Session-Timeout AVP shall be present in requests or responses.

7.1.5

Transport protocol

Diameter messages over the S6a, S6d, S13, S13', S7a and S7d interfaces shall make use of SCTP IETF RFC 4960 [14].

Routing considerations

This clause specifies the use of the Diameter routing AVPs Destination-Realm and Destination-Host.
If an MME or SGSN knows the address/name of the HSS for a certain user, and the associated home network domain
name, both the Destination-Realm and Destination-Host AVPs shall be present in the request.
NOTE: When sending a ULR command for a certain user due to HSS restoration procedure (i.e, after the
MME/SGSN have received a Reset command from the HSS), the MME or the SGSN might consider the
stored address/name of the HSS for the user to be invalid and hence not known.
If an MME or SGSN knows only the home network domain name for a certain user, the Destination-Realm AVP shall
be present and the command shall be routed to the next Diameter node.
If an MME or SGSN knows only the identity of the user, the home network domain name shall be derived from the
user's IMSI (MNC and MCC values) to construct the EPC Home Network Realm/Domain, as indicated in
3GPP TS 23.003 [3], clause 19.2, and use it as Destination-Realm.
Consequently, the Destination-Host AVP is declared as optional in the ABNF for all requests initiated by an MME or
SGSN.
The address/name of the EIR shall be locally configured in the MME.
Requests initiated by the HSS towards an MME or SGSN shall include both Destination-Host and Destination-Realm
AVPs.
The HSS obtains the Destination-Host AVP to use in requests towards an MME or SGSN, from the Origin-Host AVP
received in previous requests from the MME or SGSN. Consequently, the Destination-Host AVP is declared as
mandatory in the ABNF for all requests initiated by the HSS. The Origin-Host AVP received in requests from the MME
may contain a Diameter identity of the MME encoded as specified in clause 19.4.2.4 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [3]. The
Origin-Host AVP received in requests from the SGSN may contain a Diameter identity of the SGSN encoded as
specified in clause 19.4.2.6 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [3].
The HSS obtains the Destination-Realm AVP to use in requests towards an MME or SGSN, from the Origin-Realm
AVP received in previous requests from the MME or SGSN. The Origin-Realm AVP in the requests received by the
HSS in roaming cases, should contain the domain name of the network to which the MME or the SGSN belongs,
encoded as specified in clause 19.2 of 3GPP TS 23.003 [3].
The Destination-Realm AVP is declared as mandatory in the ABNF for all requests.
If the Vendor-Specific-Application-ID AVP is received in any of the commands defined in this specification, it shall be
ignored by the receiving node, and it shall not be used for routing purposes.

7.1.7

Advertising Application Support

The HSS, MME, SGSN and EIR shall advertise support of the Diameter S6a/S6d and/or S13/S13' Application by
including the value of the application identifier in the Auth-Application-Id AVP within the Vendor-SpecificApplication-Id grouped AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands.
The vendor identifier value of 3GPP (10415) shall be included in the Supported-Vendor-Id AVP of the CapabilitiesExchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands, and in the Vendor-Id AVP within the VendorSpecific-Application-Id grouped AVP of the Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer
commands.
The Vendor-Id AVP included in Capabilities-Exchange-Request and Capabilities-Exchange-Answer commands that is
not included in the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVPs as described above shall indicate the manufacturer of the
Diameter node as per IETF RFC 6733 [61].

7.1.8

Diameter Application Identifier

This clause specifies three Diameter applications: The S6a/S6d interface application, the S13/S13' interface application,
and the S7a/S7d interface application.
The S6a/S6d interface application allows a Diameter server and a Diameter client:

ETSI

3GPP TS 29.272 version 16.5.0 Release 16

69

-

to exchange location information;

-

to authorize a user to access the EPS;

-

to exchange authentication information;

-

to download and handle changes in the subscriber data stored in the server.

ETSI TS 129 272 V16.5.0 (2021-01)

The S6a/S6d interface protocol shall be defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter application, where the vendor is
3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is
10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the S6a/S6d interface application is 16777251 (allocated by IANA).
The S13/S13' interface application allows a Diameter server and a Diameter client:
-

to check the validity of the ME Identity.

The S13/S13' interface protocol shall be defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter application, where the vendor is
3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is
10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the S13/S13' interface application is 16777252 (allocated by IANA).
The S7a/S7d interface application allows a Diameter server and a Diameter client:
-

to authorize a user to access CSGs identified in the CSS while roaming;

-

to download and handle changes in CSG subscriber data stored in the CSS.

The S7a/S7d interface protocol shall be defined as an IETF vendor specific Diameter application, where the vendor is
3GPP. The vendor identifier assigned by IANA to 3GPP (http://www.iana.org/assignments/enterprise-numbers) is
10415.
The Diameter application identifier assigned to the S7a/S7d interface application is 16777308 (allocated by IANA).

7.1.9

Use of the Supported-Features AVP

When new functionality is introduced on the S6a/S6d interfaces, it should be defined as optional. If backwards
incompatible changes can not be avoided, the new functionality shall be introduced as a new feature and support
advertised with the Supported-Features AVP. The usage of the Supported-Features AVP on the S6a/S6d interfaces is
consistent with the procedures for the dynamic discovery of supported features as defined in clause 7.2 of
3GPP TS 29.229 [9].
When extending the application by adding new AVPs for a feature, the new AVPs shall have the M bit cleared and the
AVP shall not be defined mandatory in the command ABNF.
As defined in 3GPP TS 29.229 [9], the Supported-Features AVP is of type grouped and contains the Vendor-Id,
Feature-List-ID and Feature-List AVPs. On the all reference points as specified in this specificaion, the SupportedFeatures AVP is used to identify features that have been defined by 3GPP and hence, for features defined in this
document, the Vendor-Id AVP shall contain the vendor ID of 3GPP (10415). If there are multiple feature lists defined
for the reference point, the Feature-List-ID AVP shall differentiate those lists from one another.
The Table 7.3.10/1 defines the features applicable to the S6a/S6d interfaces for the feature list with a Feature-List-ID of
1. The Table 7.3.10/2 defines the features applicable to the S6a/S6d interfaces for the feature list with a Feature-List-ID
of 2.
NOTE 1: If the support of a feature by the receiver is required in order for the receiver to be able to correctly
process the request command, then the feature is included in the Supported-Features AVP and the M-bit
of the Supported-Features AVP has to be set in the request command, according to 3GPP TS 29.229 [9]
clause 7.2.1.

ETSI

3GPP TS 29.272 version 16.5.0 Release 16

70

ETSI TS 129 272 V16.5.0 (2021-01)

NOTE 2: Currently none of the features that can be included in the Supported-Features AVP of the ULR command
requires that the HSS supports them to successfully process the ULR command. For this reason the MME
or SGSN does not need to set the M-bit of the Supported-Features AVP in the ULR command. This
corresponds to the exception to the general rule requiring the setting of the M-bit of the SupportedFeatures AVP in a request described in 3GPP TS 29.229 [9] clause 7.2.1. Setting the M-bit of the
Supported-Features AVP in the ULR command will mean that, if any of the features is not supported, the
HSS will reject the ULR command as according to 3GPP TS 29.229 [9] clause 7.2.1.

7.2

Commands

7.2.1

Introduction

This clause defines the Command code values and related ABNF for each command described in this specification.

7.2.2

Command-Code values

This clause defines Command-Code values for the S6a/S6d interface application and S13/S13' interface application as
allocated by IANA in the IETF RFC 5516 [32].
Every command is defined by means of the ABNF syntax IETF RFC 2234 [7], according to the Command Code Format
(CCF) specification defined in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. In the case, the definition and use of an AVP is not specified in
this document, the guidelines in IETF RFC 6733 [61] shall apply.
The Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP shall not be included in any command sent by Diameter nodes supporting
applications defined in this specification. If the Vendor-Specific-Application-Id AVP is received in any of the
commands defined in this specification, it shall be ignored by the receiving node.
NOTE:

The Vendor-Specific-Application-Id is included as an optional AVP in all Command Code Format
specifications defined in this specification in order to overcome potential interoperability issues with
intermediate Diameter agents non-compliant with the IETF RFC 6733 [61].

ETSI TS 129 272 V16.5.0 (2021-01)

The following table specifies the Diameter AVPs defined for the S6a/S6d interface protocol, the S7a/S7d interface
protocol and the S13/S13' interface protocol, their AVP Code values, types, possible flag values and whether or not the
AVP may be encrypted. The Vendor-ID header of all AVPs defined in this specification shall be set to 3GPP (10415).
For all AVPs which contain bit masks and are of the type Unsigned32, e.g., ULR-Flags, DSR-Flags, PUA-Flags, etc.,
bit 0 shall be the least significant bit. For example, to get the value of bit 0, a bit mask of 0x0001 should be used.

NOTE 1: The AVP header bit denoted as "M", indicates whether support of the AVP is required. The AVP header bit
denoted as "V", indicates whether the optional Vendor-ID field is present in the AVP header. For further details,
see IETF RFC 6733 [61].
NOTE 2: If the M-bit is set for an AVP and the receiver does not understand the AVP, it shall return a rejection. If the M-bit
is not set for an AVP, the receiver shall not return a rejection, whether or not it understands the AVP. If the
receiver understands the AVP but the M-bit value does not match with the definition in this table, the receiver
shall ignore the M-bit.

The following table specifies the Diameter AVPs re-used by the S6a/S6d interface protocol from existing Diameter
Applications, including a reference to their respective specifications and when needed, a short description of their use
within S6a and S6d.

Any other AVPs from existing Diameter Applications, except for the AVPs from Diameter base protocol specified in
IETF RFC 6733 [61], do not need to be supported. The AVPs from the Diameter base protocol specified in
IETF RFC 6733 [61] are not included in table 7.3.1/2, but they may be re-used for the S6a/S6d protocol, the
S7a/S7protocol and the S13/S13' protocol.

Description
This bit, when set, indicates that the HSS shall send Cancel
Location to the SGSN. An SGSN shall not set this bit when
sending ULR.
This bit, when set, indicates that the ULR message is sent on
the S6a interface, i.e. the source node is an MME (or a
combined MME/SGSN to which the UE is attached via EUTRAN).
This bit, when cleared, indicates that the ULR message is sent
on the S6d interface, i.e. the source node is an SGSN (or a
combined MME/SGSN to which the UE is attached via UTRAN
or GERAN).
This bit, when set, indicates that the HSS may skip subscription
data in ULA. If the subscription data has changed in the HSS
after the last successful update of the MME/SGSN, the HSS
shall ignore this bit and send the updated subscription data. If
the HSS effectively skips the sending of subscription data, the
GPRS-Subscription-Data-Indicator flag can be ignored.
This bit, when set, indicates that the HSS shall include in the
ULA command the GPRS subscription data, if available in the
HSS; it shall be included in the GPRS-Subscription-Data AVP
inside the Subscription-Data AVP (see 7.3.2).
Otherwise, the HSS shall not include the GPRS-SubscriptionData AVP in the response, unless the Update Location Request
is received over the S6d interface and there is no APN
configuration profile stored for the subscriber, or when the
subscription data is returned by a Pre-Rel-8 HSS (via an IWF).
A standalone MME shall not set this bit when sending a ULR.
This bit, when set, indicates that the requesting node is a
combined MME/SGSN.
This bit, when cleared, indicates that the requesting node is a
single MME or SGSN; in this case, if the S6a/S6d-Indicator is
set, the HSS may skip the check of those supported features
only applicable to the SGSN, and if, in addition the MME does
not request to be registered for SMS, the HSS may
consequently skip the download of the SMS related subscription
data to a standalone MME. NOTE2
This bit, when set, indicates that the HSS shall send Cancel
Location to the MME or SGSN if there is the MME or SGSN
registration.
This bit, when set, indicates to the HSS that the UE does not
support neither UE Based nor UE Assisted positioning methods
for Packet Switched Location Services. The MME shall set this
bit on the basis of the UE capability information. The SGSN shall
set this bit on the basis of the UE capability information and the
access technology supported by the SGSN.
This bit, when set, indicates that the UE indicated "SMS only"
when requesting a combined IMSI attach or combined RA/LU.
This bit, when set by an MME over S6a interface, indicates that
the HSS+UDM shall not send
Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification to the registered AMF
(if any); when not set by an MME over S6a interface, it indicates
that the HSS+UDM shall send
Nudm_UECM_DeregistrationNotification to the registered AMF
(if any). See 3GPP TS 29.503 [66].

An SGSN shall not set this bit when sending ULR over S6d
interface.
Bits not defined in this table shall be cleared by the sending MME or SGSN and discarded
by the receiving HSS.
If the MME is registered for SMS then the HSS will download the SMS related data also
for the standalone MME.

User identity to HSS resolution

The User identity to HSS resolution mechanism enables the MME, SGSN (for non-roaming case) or Diameter
Relay/proxy agents in the home network (for roaming case) to find the identity of the HSS that holds the subscriber data
for a given user identity when multiple and separately addressable HSSs have been deployed in the home network. The
resolution mechanism is not required in networks that utilise a single HSS.
This User identity to HSS resolution mechanism may rely on routing capabilitites provided by Diameter and be
implemented in the home operator network within dedicated Diameter Agents (Redirect Agents or Proxy Agents)
responsible for determining the HSS identity based on the provided user identity. If this Diameter based implementation
is selected by the Home network operator, the principles described below shall apply.
In non-roaming case, in networks where more than one independently addressable HSS are deployed in the home
network, each MME and SGSN shall be configured with the address/identity of a Diameter Agent (Redirect Agent or
Proxy Agent) implementing this resolution mechanism.
For support of roaming case, Diameter Relay agents and/or Diameter Proxy agents in the home network receiving the
Diameter signalling from visited networks shall be configured with the address/identity of a Diameter Agent (Redirect
Agent or Proxy Agent) implementing this resolution mechanism.
To get the HSS identity that holds the subscriber data for a given user identity in the home network, the Diameter
request normally destined to the HSS shall be sent to a pre-configured address/identity of a Diameter agent supporting
the User identity to HSS resolution mechanism.
-

If this Diameter request is received by a Diameter Redirect Agent, the Diameter Redirect Agent shall determine
the HSS identity based on the provided user identity and shall return a notification of redirection towards the
HSS identity, in response to the Diameter request. Multiple HSS identities may be included in the response, as

ETSI

3GPP TS 29.272 version 16.5.0 Release 16

171

ETSI TS 129 272 V16.5.0 (2021-01)

specified in IETF RFC 6733 [61]. In such a case, the requesting Diameter entity shall send the Diameter request
to the first HSS identity in the ordered list received in the Diameter response from the Diameter Redirect Agent.
If no successful response to the Diameter request is received, the requesting Diameter entity shall send a
Diameter request to the next HSS identity in the ordered list. This procedure shall be repeated until a successful
response from an HSS is received. After the user identity to HSS resolution, the MME or the SGSN shall store
the determined HSS identity/name/Realm and shall use it in further Diameter requests to the same user identity.
-

If this Diameter request is received by a Diameter Proxy Agent, the Diameter Proxy Agent shall determine the
HSS identity based on the provided user identity and - if the Diameter load control mechanism is supported (see
IETF RFC 8583 [60]) - optionally also based on previously received load values from Load AVPs of type
HOST. The Diameter Proxy Agent shall then forward the Diameter request directly to the determined HSS. In
this case, the user identity to HSS resolution decision is communicated to the MME/SGSN in the OriginHost/Origin-Realm AVPs of the response. The MME or the SGSN may store the determined HSS
identity/name/Realm and may use it in further Diameter requests to the same user identity.

In roaming case, whereas a Diameter Relay Agent is stateless, a stateful Diameter Proxy Agent in the home network
may store the determined HSS identity/name/Realm and use it in further Diameter requests associated to the same user
identity.
NOTE:

Alternatives to the user identity to HSS resolution Diameter based implementation are outside the scope
of this specification.

Annex A (normative):
MME mapping table for S6a and NAS Cause Code values
When the UE initiates Attach, Tracking Area Update or Service Request, there may be the need for the MME to
communicate with the HSS via S6a to retrieve authentication data and/or subscription data. If this retrieval is rejected
by the HSS, the received Diameter-Result-Code values or Experimental-Result values need to be mapped to appropriate
cause codes over NAS to the UE.
This mapping shall be as shown in Table A.1.
If the retrieval is successful, not needed (e.g. because data are already available) or not possible (e.g. because HSS is
unavailable or overloaded), detected error conditions need to be mapped to appropriate cause codes over NAS to the
UE.
This mapping shall be as shown in Table A.2.

Condition

NAS cause code sent to UE

The MME receives a SGsAP-LOCATION-UPDATEREJECT message from the VLR indicating in the
reject cause "IMSI unknown in HLR" or if the UE
has packet only subscription. Only used in the
Combined Tracking and Location Area Update
procedure.

#2 "IMSI Unknown in HSS"

The MME receives in Update-Location-Answer
message an indication of Roaming restricted in
MME due to unsupported feature

#14 "EPS services not allowed in this PLMN"

The MME cannot service an UE generated request
because CS domain is not available and SMS in
MME is not supported.

#18 "CS domain not available"

The value OPERATOR_DETERMINED_BARRING
is received in the Subscriber-Status AVP

#15 "No suitable cells in tracking area"

The HSS indicates that due to subscription to a
"regionally restricted service" the UE is not allowed
to operate in the tracking area.

#12 "Tracking area not allowed"

The CSG ID of the cell from where the UE has sent
the TRACKING AREA UPDATE REQUEST
message is not contained in the Allowed CSG list.

#25 "Not authorized for this CSG"

NOTE:

The MME detects by internal configuration that roaming is
not allowed.
The MME detects that it cannot send a request to the
HSS due to HSS overload (see Annex C).

Any of those NAS Cause Code values may be
sent to the UE, depending on operator's
choice / configuration, e.g. NAS Cause Code
#14 is to be sent to the UE if the network is an
LTE only network.
#11 "PLMN not allowed"
#22 "Congestion"
#42 "Severe network failure"
NOTE 1: Cause #22 should be used. In addition, the
MME may ask the UE not to retry before a backoff timer
expires, based on an operator policy. The eventual timer
value may take into account the value received in the
corresponding active overload report and operator policy.
NOTE 2: Cause #42 may be used, for attach requests, in
case of severe overload, according to operator policy.

Annex B(normative):
SGSN mapping table for S6d and NAS Cause Code values
When the UE initiates Attach, Routing Area Update or Service Request, there may be the need for the SGSN to
communicate with the HSS via S6d to retrieve authentication data and/or subscription data. If this retrieval is rejected
by the HSS, the received Diameter-Result-Code values or Experimental-Result valuesneed to be mapped to appropriate
cause codes over NAS to the UE.
NOTE:

Mapping from MAP Gr error codes to NAS Cause Code values is described in the 3GPP TS 29.010 [45].

This mapping shall be as shown in Table B.1.
If the retrieval is successful, not needed (e.g. because data are already available) or not possible (e.g. because HSS is
unavailable or overloaded), detected error conditions need to be mapped to appropriate cause codes over NAS to the
UE.
This mapping shall be as shown in Table and B.2.

ETSI TS 129 272 V16.5.0 (2021-01)

Annex C (normative):
Diameter overload control mechanism
C.1

General

IETF RFC 7683 [50] specifies a Diameter overload control mechanism which includes the definition and the transfer of
related AVPs between Diameter nodes.
Depending on regional/national requirements and network operator policy, priority traffic (e.g. MPS as described in
3GPP TS 22.153 [52]) shall be exempted from throttling due to Diameter overload control up to the point where
requested traffic reduction cannot be achieved without throttling the priority traffic.

C.2

S6a/S6d interfaces

C.2.1

General

Diameter overload control mechanism is an optional feature.
It is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7683 [50] on the S6a/S6d interfaces where, when applied, the MME or the
SGSN shall behave as reacting nodes and the HSS as a reporting node.

C.2.2

HSS behaviour

The HSS requests traffic reduction from its clients when the HSS is in an overload situation, including OC-OLR AVP
in answer commands as described in IETF RFC 7683 [50].
The HSS identifies that it is in an overload situation by implementation specific means. For example, the HSS may take
into account the traffic over the S6a/d interfaces or other interfaces, the level of usage of internal resources (CPU,
memory), the access to external resources, etc.
The HSS determines the specific contents of OC-OLR AVP in overload reports and the HSS decides when to send OCOLR AVPs by implementation specific means.

C.2.3

MME/SGSN behaviour

The MME/SGSN applies required traffic reduction received in answer commands to subsequent applicable requests, as
per RFC 7683 [50].
Requested traffic reduction is achieved by the MME/SGSN by implementation specific means. For example, it may
implement message throttling with prioritization or a message retaining mechanism for operations that can be
postponed.
Diameter requests related to priority traffic (e.g. MPS as identified by the MME/SGSN through access procedures) and
emergency have the highest priority. Depending on regional/national regulatory and operator policies, these Diameter
requests shall be the last to be throttled, when the MME/SGSN has to apply traffic reduction. Relative priority amongst
various priority traffic (e.g. MPS) and emergency traffic is subject to regional/national regulatory and operator policies.
As a result of the need to throttle traffic, the MME or SGSN may reject Attach, Tracking Area Update or Service
Requests initiated by UEs. The possible NAS causes are described in the Annex A and B.

ETSI TS 129 272 V16.5.0 (2021-01)

Annex D (Informative):
Diameter overload control node behaviour
D.1

Message prioritisation over S6a/d

This clause describes possible behaviours of the MME/SGSN regarding message prioritisation as guidance and for an
informative purpose when Diameter overload control is applied over S6a/d.
When the HSS is overloaded, the MME/SGSN will receive overload reports from the HSS requesting a reduction of the
requests sent by the MME/SGSN. The following and not exhaustive considerations may be taken into account for the
MME/SGSN throttling decisions:
-

Prioritisation of requests related to priority traffic (e.g. MPS as identified by the MME/SGSN through access
procedures, emergency)

-

Identification of the procedures that can be deferred (e.g. UE reachable notification, purge after a long inactivity
time), so to avoid to drop non deferrable procedures;

-

Prioritisation of certain types of requests (i.e. between AIR, ULR, PUR, NOR) according to the context of their
use, in particular:

-

-

Higher prioritisation of ULR commands when used in relation with mobility management (e.g. handover) for
an attached user, so to avoid the interruption of the service for the user;

-

Lower prioritisation of AIR and ULR commands when related to an initial attach, so to avoid the attachment
of new users;

Skipping of optional authentication (e.g. in TAU procedures).

ETSI TS 129 272 V16.5.0 (2021-01)

Annex E (normative):
Diameter message priority mechanism
E.1

General

IETF RFC 7944 [57] specifies a Diameter routing message priority mechanism that allows Diameter nodes to indicate
the relative priority of Diameter messages. With this information, other Diameter nodes may leverage the relative
priority of Diameter messages into routing, resource allocation, set the DSCP marking for transport of the associated
Diameter message, and also abatement decisions when overload control is applied.

E.2

S6a/S6d interfaces

E.2.1

General

The Diameter message priority mechanism is an optional feature.
It is recommended to make use of IETF RFC 7944 [57] over the S6a/S6d interfaces of an operator network when the
overload control defined in Annex C is applied on these S6a/d interfaces.

E.2.2

HSS, CSS, EIR behaviour

When the HSS, the CSS or the EIR supports the Diameter message priority mechanism, the HSS, the CSS, or the EIR
shall comply with IETF RFC 7944 [57].
The HSS or the CSS sending a request shall determine the required priority according to its policies. When priority is
required, the HSS or the CSS shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the request it sends,
and shall prioritise the request according to the required priority level.
When the HSS or the CSS receives the corresponding response, the HSS or the CSS shall prioritise the received
response according to the priority level received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according
to the priority level of the corresponding request.
When the HSS, the CSS, or the EIR receives a request, it shall handle the request according to the received DRMP AVP
priority level. For the response, the HSS, the CSS, or the EIR may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP
according to its policies and shall handle the response according to the required priority level. If the required priority
level is different from the priority level received in the request, the HSS, the CSS, or the EIR shall include the DRMP
AVP in the response.If:
-

the HSS, the CSS or the EIR supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism for DSCP marking
purposes,

-

the transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and

-

message-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack transporting Diameter,

then the HSS, the CSS or the EIR shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request or response according to the
required priority level.
When not-explicitly requested, the inclusion and priority value of the DRMP AVP in Diameter messages are
implementation specific.

E.2.3

MME/SGSN behaviour

When the MME/SGSN supports the Diameter message priority mechanism, the MME/SGSN shall comply with
IETF RFC 7944 [57].

ETSI

3GPP TS 29.272 version 16.5.0 Release 16

180

ETSI TS 129 272 V16.5.0 (2021-01)

The MME/SGSN sending a request shall determine the required priority according to its policies. When priority is
required, the MME/SGSN shall include the DRMP AVP indicating the required priority level in the request it sends,
and shall prioritise the requests according to the required priority level.
When the MME/SGSN receives the corresponding response, it shall prioritise the received response according to the
priority level received within the DRMP AVP if present in the response, otherwise according to the priority level of the
corresponding request.
When the MME/SGSN receives a request, it shall handle the request according to the received DRMP AVP priority
level. For the response, it may modify the priority level received in the DRMP AVP according to its policies and shall
handle the response according to the required priority level. If the required priority level is different from the priority
level received in the request, it shall include the DRMP AVP in the response.
If:
-

the MME/SGSN supports using the Diameter message priority mechanism for DSCP marking purposes,

-

the transport network utilizes DSCP marking, and

-

message-dependant DSCP marking is possible for the protocol stack transporting Diameter,

then the MME/SGSN shall set the DSCP marking for transport of the request or response according to the required
priority level.
Diameter requests related to high priority traffic (e.g. MPS as identified by the MME/SGSN via the RRC Establishment
Cause IE set to the highPriorityAccess value as per 3GPP TS 36.413 [19] or through subscription information in the
MPS-Priority AVP, emergency) shall contain a DRMP AVP with a high priority of which the level value is operator
dependent.
When not-explicitly requested, the inclusion and priority value of the DRMP AVP in Diameter messages are
implementation specific.

The HSS may report its current load by including a Load AVP of type HOST in answer commands as described in
IETF RFC 8583 [60].
The HSS calculates its current load by implementation specific means. For example, the HSS may take into account the
traffic over the S6a/d interfaces or other interfaces, the level of usage of internal resources (CPU, memory), the access
to external resources, etc.
The HSS determines when to send Load AVPs of type HOST by implementation specific means.

F.2.3
